    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Welcome to my Lasagne recipe page. The page was created by me as I learn how to use HTML.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Some pancetta</li>
    <li>Diced carrot (2)</li>
    <li>Diced onion</li>
    <li>7 ounces ground beef</li>
    <li>Red wine</li>
    <Li>Vegetable stock</Li>
    <li>Pasta sheets</li>
    <li>Bechamel sauce</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook and stir until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring and mashing meat into small crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes more.</li>
    <li>Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. Add tomato sauce and stir; pour in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to allow steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Pour 1 more cup of broth into the sauce. Continue simmering until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more broth only if absolutely necessary; ragu should drop, not run, off a spoon.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese on top has browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Let lasagne rest for 10 or 15 minutes at room temperature before slicing.</li>
</ol>
